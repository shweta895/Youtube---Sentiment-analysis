# Youtube_Sentiment_analysis
This project is centered on the comprehensive analysis of datasets obtained from YouTube. The initial phase of our analysis involved evaluating the sentiment of viewers, specifically focusing on the polarity of emotions expressed in their textual content.

Subsequently, we conducted a WordCloud analysis using the same dataset, segregating it into positive and negative sentences. Additionally, we employed the emoji module to examine the prevalent use of emojis by viewers, identifying common ones such as "funny," "smile," and "love."

Furthermore, our investigation delved into the determination of the most popular video categories based on the number of likes they received. We also assessed audience engagement levels and identified the YouTube channels hosting the highest number of trending videos.

In a separate facet of our analysis, we explored whether the presence of punctuations in video titles and tags had any discernible correlation with metrics such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments.
